For Volaser 2
- test new laser modules.
- create 'dummy' firmwares that don't need to communicate with any hardware (this should be done for motor already)
  - add a debug preprocessor flag to turn on and off serial communication. Does this matter?

- test power circuit for lasers + stepper and for winch.
- Design a PCB for winch and lasers in kicad
- send off PCB order
- order PCB components + battery holders.
